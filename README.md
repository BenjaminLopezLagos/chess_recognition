# use python 3.10!
## Project for a chess robot that can take pictures of a previously calibrated chess board, and then it goes through each piece on the board and classifies them by color and type (or if there are no pieces). The results gotten from going through the board are then converted into a FEN string, which goes into a Stockfish engine and it returns the cpu's best move.
